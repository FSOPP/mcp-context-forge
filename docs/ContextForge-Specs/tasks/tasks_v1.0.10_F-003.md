# Tasks v1.0.10 F-003 — Identity, Teams and Access Control

> **Inverted document.** These are not tasks to do; they are an inventory of shipped work, one row
> per unit that exists, each pointing at the artefact. The `done-when` column holds the check that
> *would* prove the row — which is what the status column then has to cash.

## Implementation status

States and what `done` costs: `../status-model.md`. A row starts at `todo` and reaches `done` only
when its done-when check ran **here** and the note records the command and result.

## Open questions

- OPEN: what work on this feature is in flight but not yet in the tree? A working tree shows what
  landed, never what is half-finished elsewhere.
- OPEN: which of these rows were one change and which accumulated over many? The grouping is by
  surface, not by the history that produced it.
- OPEN: Why is `email_users.email` the foreign-key target rather than `email_users.id`? Changing a user's email address now rewrites every referencing row, and nothing states whether that is intended or simply inherited.
